              Adalaj Stepwell, also known as Adalaj Vav, is a five-story
              stepwell located in the village of Adalaj in the Indian state of
              Gujarat. It was built in 1499 by Queen Rudabai, the wife of the
              Vaghela chief, Veer Singh. One of the unique features of the
              stepwell is the presence of an octagonal opening in the ceiling of
              the fourth level. This opening allows sunlight to enter the
              stepwell, illuminating carvings and sculptures.
              Today, Adalaj Stepwell is a popular tourist destination and a
              testament to the architectural and engineering skills of ancient
              India.
